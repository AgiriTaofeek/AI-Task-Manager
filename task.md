## 🧠 Example User Flow

Sarah, an eCommerce owner, uploads her sales data CSV.

The app immediately:

- Shows her top 5 selling products
- Warns her that sales dipped in Q3
- Lets her drag “Date” vs “Revenue” to build a chart
- She asks: “Why did revenue drop in March?”
- The GPT engine replies: “Revenue dropped 30% due to low East region performance.”

This feels like magic, and you built the frontend that makes it work.
